Owly maintains a simple and transparent fee structure.

## Fee Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Trading Fees" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Standard Hyperliquid trading fees apply to all trades.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance Fees" icon="chart-line">
    A percentage of profits paid to successful curators.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Detailed Breakdown

| Fee Type | Rate | When Applied |
|----------|------|--------------|
| **Trading Fee** | 0.01% - 0.035% | Per trade (Hyperliquid standard) |
| **Performance Fee** | 10% - 30% | On profitable periods |
| **Management Fee** | 0% | Not applicable |
| **Withdrawal Fee** | 0% | Network gas only |

## Performance Fee Calculation

Performance fees are only charged on profits:

```
Performance Fee = Net Profit × Fee Percentage
```

### Example

If you make $1,000 profit and the curator's fee is 20%:
- **Your profit after fees**: $800
- **Curator receives**: $200

<Note>
  Performance fees are calculated using a high-water mark system. You only pay fees on new profits, not on recovering previous losses.
</Note>

## High-Water Mark Explained

The high-water mark ensures you don't pay fees twice on the same gains:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Deposit">
    You deposit $10,000. High-water mark = $10,000
  </Step>
  <Step title="Profit Period">
    Account grows to $12,000. Fee charged on $2,000 profit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Loss Period">
    Account drops to $11,000. No fee charged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recovery">
    Account returns to $12,000. No fee (already paid on this level).
  </Step>
  <Step title="New Profits">
    Account grows to $14,000. Fee charged on $2,000 new profit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## No Hidden Fees

Owly does not charge:
- ❌ Account opening fees
- ❌ Monthly subscription fees
- ❌ Deposit fees
- ❌ Inactivity fees

<Tip>
  Always check a curator's fee percentage before starting copy trading. Higher fees require proportionally higher returns to be worthwhile.
