## Step 1: Preparation

### 1.1 Register Owly Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Owly">
    Go to [app.owly.fi](https://app.owly.fi)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    Click "Connect Wallet" to connect your main wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign Verification">
    Sign the verification message to confirm wallet ownership
  </Step>
  <Step title="Registration Complete">
    Complete registration and enter the Owly platform
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 1.2 Confirm Fund Manager Registration

<Check>Fund manager must be a registered Owly user</Check>
<Check>Obtain the fund manager's wallet address</Check>

<Warning>
If the fund manager is not registered, the assignment will fail.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Sub Account and API on Hyperliquid

### 2.1 Prerequisites

<Note>
Creating a Sub Account requires your main account to have reached **100,000 USDC trading volume**.
</Note>

### 2.2 Create Sub Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Hyperliquid">
    Go to [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Wallet">
    Connect your main wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Sub Accounts">
    Find Sub Accounts in the menu

    **Important**: Securely save the private key - it's only shown once
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Each Sub Account must have its own API Key!**

While one API Key can technically operate all Sub Accounts, due to Nonce mechanism limitations, **one API Key cannot operate multiple Sub Accounts simultaneously**, otherwise trading conflicts will occur.

Owly requires: **One Sub Account = One dedicated API Key**.

## Permissions & Security

### API Key Technical Limitations

| Limitation | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|

| **Nonce Mechanism** | Each API Key uses an independent Nonce sequence |
| **Concurrency Limit** | One API Key cannot operate multiple Sub Accounts simultaneously (Nonce conflict) |

### API Key Permissions
