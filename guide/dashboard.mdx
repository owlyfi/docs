## Interpreting Metrics

### ROI (Return on Investment)

```
ROI = (Current Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value × 100%
```

### Win Rate

```
Win Rate = Profitable Trades / Total Trades × 100%
```

### Max Drawdown

The largest peak-to-trough decline in your portfolio value.

<Tip>
  Focus on risk-adjusted returns rather than absolute PnL. A trader with 50% returns and 10% max drawdown is often better than one with 100% returns and 50% drawdown.
