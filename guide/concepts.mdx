## Account Types

Understanding the three types of copy trading accounts supported by Owly is crucial for choosing the best option for you.

### 1. API Wallet (API Agent Wallet)
This is the advanced method recommended by Owly.
- **Mechanism**: Uses Hyperliquid's Agent Wallet API for trading.
- **Nature**: **Non-custodial**. You have full control over your funds.
- **Features**: Each sub-account is essentially an independent Hyperliquid trading account managed via API authorization.
- **Pros**: No high trading volume requirement to create, suitable for most users.

### 2. Hyperliquid Sub-account
Directly imports existing sub-accounts using Hyperliquid's native sub-account feature.
- **Mechanism**: Links directly to your existing Hyperliquid sub-account.
- **Nature**: **Non-custodial**.
- **Features**: Funds are managed and transferred within a single Hyperliquid master account.
- **Pros**: Unified fund management.
- **Cons**: Volume requirement; Hyperliquid requires the master account to have **100,000 USDC** trading volume on Hyperliquid to create sub-accounts.

### 3. Owly Managed
- **Mechanism**: Accounts created and managed for you by Owly.
- **Nature**: **Custodial**.
- **Features**: Extremely simple operation, generated with just a few clicks.
- **Cons**: Users do not hold the private keys; security depends on the platform.
- **Recommendation**: We strongly recommend the first two non-custodial options to ensure absolute asset security.

## Key Indicators

Refer to these indicators when selecting traders.

### ROI (Return on Investment)
`ROI = (Current Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value × 100%`
Measures the profitability of a strategy. We typically display 7-day, 30-day, or Total ROI.

### Sharpe Ratio
Measures the excess return per unit of risk taken.
- **> 1**: Good
- **> 2**: Excellent
- **> 3**: Exceptional
A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better returns for the same level of risk.

### Max Drawdown
The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio.
- **Significance**: Represents the potential loss in a worst-case scenario. Lower drawdown indicates a more robust strategy.

### Win Rate
`Win Rate = Winning Trades / Total Trades`
- **Note**: A high win rate does not necessarily mean high profits (if individual losses are large). It should be considered alongside the Profit/Loss ratio.

### Volatility
Measures the degree of variation in returns. Lower volatility means a smoother equity curve.

## Copy Trading Logic

### Multi-Dimensional Ranking System
Owly moves beyond single-factor ROI ranking, using a multi-dimensional scoring system to find "Smart Money":
- **Profitability**: ROI, Absolute Profit
- **Risk Control**: Drawdown Control, Sharpe Ratio
- **Stability**: Trading Frequency, Capacity
We algorithmically synthesize these metrics to recommend traders with the best overall performance.

### Portfolio SL/TP (Stop Loss/Take Profit)
Unlike traditional single-order stop-loss, Owly provides portfolio-level risk control.
- **Mechanism**: The system monitors the net equity of the entire sub-account.
- **Trigger**: When the total equity of the sub-account reaches your set Take Profit or Stop Loss level, the system automatically closes all positions and stops copy trading.
- **Advantage**: Effectively prevents a single "black swan" event from wiping out the entire account, protecting your principal.
