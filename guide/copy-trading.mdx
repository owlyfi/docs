## Copy Ratio Explained

The copy ratio determines how your position sizes compare to the trader's:

| Copy Ratio | Trader Opens $1000 | You Open |
|------------|-------------------|----------|
| 0.5x | $1000 | $500 |
| 1x | $1000 | $1000 |
| 2x | $1000 | $2000 |

<Warning>
  Higher copy ratios amplify both profits AND losses. Use with caution.
