The way individual investors access professional trading strategies has evolved significantly. Owly represents the next leap forward in this evolution.

## 1.0: Quantitative Funds (The Black Box)

Historically, top-tier trading strategies were the exclusive domain of institutions and the ultra-wealthy.

*   **High Barrier**: Minimum investments often starting at $1M+.
*   **Black Box**: Investors have zero visibility into specific trades or logic.
*   **Uncertain Quality**: Returns depend entirely on luck and the fund's marketing ability; investors have little way to verify true skill before committing.
*   **Lock-up Periods**: Capital is tied up for months or years with limited liquidity.

## 2.0: CEX Copy Trading (The Wild West)

Centralized Exchanges (CEX) democratized access, allowing retail users to follow traders, but introduced critical risks.

*   **Custodial Risk**: *"Not your keys, not your coins."* You surrender control of your assets to the exchange.
*   **Limited Access**: Only traders who onboard with the specific exchange are available.
*   **Lack of Top Strategies**: Top-tier traders rarely open their positions for copying, making it impossible for average users to access the best strategies.
*   **Opaque Data**: Performance metrics can be cherry-picked, manipulating leaderboards to show only survivors.

## 3.0: Owly (The Intelligent Future)

**Owly** combines the professional performance of institutional tools with the transparency and security of DeFi. We are not just a tool; we are your strategy provider for decentralized wealth management.
