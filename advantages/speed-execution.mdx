Owly leverages Hyperliquid's high-performance infrastructure to deliver industry-leading copy trading speed.

## Why Speed Matters

In copy trading, every millisecond counts. The delay between the original trade and your copied trade directly impacts:

- **Entry Price**: Slower execution means worse fills
- **Slippage**: Market can move significantly during delays
- **Profitability**: Small differences compound over many trades

## Optimized Infrastructure

To minimize network latency, we conducted extensive evaluations across multiple geographic regions and major cloud service platforms.

- **Multi-Region Testing**: We benchmarked various cloud providers, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, measuring access latency to Hyperliquid's nodes from different global locations.
- **Top-Tier Selection**: After thousands of cross-regional stress tests, we selected the server configuration that delivers the fastest trade execution, ensuring maximum physical throughput and minimal hardware-level latency.

## High-Performance SDK

To achieve extreme execution efficiency, our team developed and open-sourced a high-performance SDK: **[async-hyperliquid](https://github.com/owlyfi/async-hyperliquid)**.

- **Microsecond Performance**: Compared to the second-level latency of the official SDK, we've improved order execution speed to the microsecond level.
- **Superior Throughput**: Concurrency capacity is approximately **15x** higher than the official SDK.
- **Advanced Order Support**: Native support for advanced order types, including **TP/SL (Take Profit/Stop Loss)** and **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**.
- **Full Protocol Support**: Comprehensive support for **HIP-3**.
- **Instant New Asset Support**: High-performance local caching with automatic updates for immediate support of new assets.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | Industry Average | Owly |
|--------|------------------|------|
| Detection Latency | 500ms - 2s | ~ 100ms |
| Execution Time | 1-5s | ~ 200ms |
| Average Slippage | 0.5% - 2% | ~ 0.1% |

<Info>
  Speed is crucial for high-frequency strategies. For longer-term position trading, execution speed has less impact on overall returns.
