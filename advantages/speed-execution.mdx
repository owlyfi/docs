Owly leverages Hyperliquid's high-performance infrastructure to deliver industry-leading copy trading speed.

## Why Speed Matters

In copy trading, every millisecond counts. The delay between the original trade and your copied trade directly impacts:

- **Entry Price**: Slower execution means worse fills
- **Slippage**: Market can move significantly during delays
- **Profitability**: Small differences compound over many trades
