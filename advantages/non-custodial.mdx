Your funds never leave your control. Owly operates on a fully non-custodial model.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Sub-Account">
    You create a Hyperliquid sub-account specifically for copy trading.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deposit Funds">
    You deposit funds directly into YOUR sub-account on Hyperliquid.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize Trading">
    You grant Owly permission to execute trades on your behalf.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maintain Control">
    Only YOU can withdraw funds. Owly can only trade, never withdraw.
  </Step>
</Steps>
